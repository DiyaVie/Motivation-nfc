  "Some days will test you. Things might not go as planned. Breathe. Regroup. But don’t quit. You’ve overcome so much already—don’t let this moment make you forget that.",
  "Repeat after me: I am capable. I am worthy. I am becoming. Speak life over yourself. Your words carry power.",
  "Comparison steals joy. Your journey is yours alone. Celebrate her wins without questioning yours. There’s enough room for all of us to shine.",
  "It’s okay to rest. Hustling non-stop doesn’t prove anything. Protect your peace, recharge, and then come back stronger. Burnout doesn’t wear well on you.",
  "Shatter those ceilings, sis. Walk into every room like you belong—because you do. Don’t dim your light for anyone uncomfortable with your glow.",
  "That idea you’ve been sitting on? Start. That application you’ve been hesitating to submit? Do it. Closed mouths don’t get fed. Speak up, show up, go after it.",
  "Celebrate the silent wins: getting out of bed when you didn’t want to, sending that email, choosing yourself. The small steps count just as much.",
  "Surround yourself with women who remind you of your power. Iron sharpens iron. Find your tribe—the ones who push you to dream bigger.",
  "Your future self is watching, grateful you didn’t give up. Keep believing, keep blooming, keep securing the bag. You are magic. And I’m rooting for you. Always.",
